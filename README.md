# 📊 AtliQ Hardware - Excel Analytics Project
This project is part of the CodeBasics data analytics course, where I performed end-to-end sales and finance analytics using **Excel (Pivot Tables, Power Query, and Data Modeling)**.  
The goal was to build interactive business reports for AtliQ Hardware, covering customer performance, product trends, market vs target comparison, and full P&L analysis.

## 🚀 Project Objectives
Using the provided raw data, I created reports that answer key business questions:

### ✔ What are the **top 10 products** based on % increase in net sales (2020 → 2021)?  
### ✔ Create a **division-level report** for net sales in 2020 & 2021 with growth %.  
### ✔ Identify the **top 5 and bottom 5 products** by quantity sold.  
### ✔ Which new products were launched in **2021**?  
### ✔ What are the **top 5 countries** by net sales in 2021?  

All reports were generated using:
- Pivot Tables  
- Power Query (ETL)  
- Data Modeling (relationships + date tables)  
- Conditional formatting  
- Business metrics (Net Sales, COGS, GM%)
